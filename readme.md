# Sursis - network notebook for personal uses

Sursis is a simple web app built on top of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). In a way, it abuses the goals of Streamlit, which are closer to Jupyter notebooks, but is very simply written and does the trick for me.

The concept is that you have a single undirected, unweighted graph to connect across many domains. Not unlike a written personal notes.txt or outline, but not sequential and able to reach back and connect separate "moments".


Sursis runs locally; or preferrably on a cheap VPS/Digital Ocean-type VM so you'll be able to use it on your phone. 


## Installing

    pip install -r requirements.txt
